# Ingestia

Ingestia is a metadata-driven framework designed to transform documentation, architectural standards, and governance from static artifacts into executable parameters.

Instead of treating documentation as the final step of a project, Ingestia makes it the starting point of execution.

Architecture rules, naming standards, and integrity definitions are not described — they are enforced.

## Why Ingestia Exists

Modern Lakehouse projects operate under constant pressure:

- faster delivery cycles
- increasing data sources
- multiple domains working in parallel
- high expectations for data quality and traceability

In this environment, documentation and governance often become bottlenecks.

When over-engineered, they slow delivery.  
When ignored, they create chaos.

Ingestia was created to resolve this tension.

It ensures that:

- standards do not slow down execution
- governance is not optional
- ingestion is consistent across teams
- quality rules are executable, not theoretical

## The Core Principle

**Documentation is not an artifact. It is a parameter.**

Ingestia is built around a metadata-driven approach where:

- structural definitions
- naming conventions
- integrity rules
- execution behavior

are defined in dictionaries and consumed directly by the ingestion engine.

This eliminates hidden logic inside notebooks and pipelines.

Execution becomes deterministic, reproducible, and transparent.

## What Ingestia Provides

Ingestia defines a structured Lakehouse model composed of:

- **Layering strategy** (Raw, Standardized, Conformed, Serving)
- **Metadata dictionaries** that describe structure and constraints
- **Execution engine** that applies those definitions consistently
- **Control columns and batching standards**
- **Integrity enforcement and quarantine strategy**

The result is a system where:

- projects remain standardized
- delivery speed is maintained
- governance scales with growth
- environments remain manageable over time

## Who It Is For

Ingestia is designed for:

- Data Architects defining cross-domain standards
- Data Engineers building ingestion and transformation pipelines
- Platform teams implementing scalable LakeOps practices

It is not a no-code ingestion tool.  
It is not a data warehouse methodology.

It is an execution framework for disciplined Lakehouse architecture.

## What You Will Find in This Documentation

This documentation describes:

- The philosophy and design principles behind Ingestia
- The architectural model and layering strategy
- The metadata-driven structure that powers execution
- The ingestion engine and enforcement mechanisms
- The governance and quality model
- Patterns and anti-patterns observed in real-world projects

If your goal is to deliver fast without sacrificing standards,  
Ingestia was built for that purpose.
